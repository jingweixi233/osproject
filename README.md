This is a project for Operating System in Android kernel.

Problem1

In Linux, we can use ps to check the current process.

Furthermore, we can use pstree to see the process tree intuitively.

In Android, we can use ps, but cannot use pstree.

The problem1 is make a kernel module for function pstree.


Problem2

Writing a program to use pstree.

Problem3

Generate a new process and output “StudentIDParent” with PID, then generates its children process output “StudentIDChild” with PID.

Use execl to execute ptree in the child process，show the relationship between above two process.

Problem4

Develop a Server-Client, which receives plaintext from clients and sends the corresponding ciphertext to clients.

The detailed information is in README.pdf and CS356.pdf
